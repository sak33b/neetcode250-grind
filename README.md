## ðŸš€ LeetCode Journey: Solving the NeetCode 250

Welcome to `neetcode250-grind`! This repository documents my journey to systematically solve all problems from the popular [NeetCode 250 list](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250). This project is dedicated to learning and practicing essential algorithms and data structures, and improving problem-solving skills.

### Why the NeetCode 250?

The NeetCode 250 is a curated list covering a wide range of fundamental LeetCode problems. By focusing on these problems, I aim to **build a solid understanding**, **prepare for technical interviews**, and **enhance my general problem-solving abilities**.

### My Approach

I'll be primarily using **Java** (Sometimes **Python**) for my solutions. For each problem, my focus will be on understanding the core concept, finding efficient solutions, and writing clear code.
